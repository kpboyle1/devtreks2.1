    ///             class. It subscribes to the RunCalculation events raised by that class. 
    ///             It runs calculations on the nodes returned by that class, 
    ///             and returns a calculated xelement to the publisher for saving.

    ///NOTES        1. This class has not been debugged. It's the same pattern as the 
    ///             devpacks in the NPVCalculators extension which has been debugged.
